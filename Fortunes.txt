``If you're not versed in DRM doublethink this concept gets quite
  tricky to explain, but in terms of quantum mechanics the
  content enters a superposition of simultaneously copied and
  uncopied states until a user collapses its wave function by
  observing the content (in physics this is called quantum
  indeterminacy or the observer's paradox). Depending on whether
  you follow the Copenhagen or many-worlds interpretation of
  quantum mechanics, things then either get wierd or very wierd.
  So in order for Windows Vista's content protection to work, it
  has to be able to violate the laws of physics and create
  numerous copies that are simultaneously not copies.''

``Superman? Superman never worked hard for anything. I suppose
  he's moral; but his morality comes from an egotistical
  understanding that there's really nothing that can stop him. He
  is a tyrant about enforcing the rules. Furthermore, Superman's
  great deeds don't come from him being clever or smarter or more
  dedicated or a better person. No, he gets everything that makes
  him unique from a difference he was just born with. If he lived
  on Krypton, he'd be just another scumbag. But because Earth's
  yellow sun gives him powers, he is able to horde them over us
  and rub our faces in this fact; a fact that he had no hand in
  and is merely the result of his illegal immigration to the
  United States.
  Superman's whole schtick is the same as if I went to a group of
  school children and, with simple riddles, double-speak, and
  mathematics, bargained them out of their lunch money. No,
  Superman is no one we should look up to and, in fact, should be
  looked upon with fear. What happens when he decides he's no

While reading ordinary books to my son (who turns three next
month), I frequently stop and ask him questions about the
story... his favorite book of late is "101 Dalmations," and
sometimes I ask him, "If you saw Cruella De Vil chasing after
those puppies, what would you say?"
One time, he said, "I would tell her, 'You don't hit puppies
because that's mean."
"And what would Cruella do?"
"She would get back in her car and drive away."
"And then what would the puppies do?" "They would get into a
helicopter and fly home."
"And what would you do?"
(pause)
"I wouldn't do anything because I'm not in the book."

``At the time, it was the thing to come up with recursive
  acronyms -- tint = "Tint Is Not Teco," eine = "Eine Is Not

  gnu. I was getting *really* tired of this one-note joke, so I
  suggested we rename U to be "line," which stood for "Line Is
  Not Recursive." Even better, we could then say things like "I
  don't use emacs; I prefer the line editor." Which would have
  been fun. But we decided that, itself, was kind of a one-note
  joke that wouldn't wear well. So we settled on "lime," which
  has the advantage of being a real word, and stood for "Lime Is

And Semper Cuni Linctus, the very night that he reamed his
subaltern for taking native superstitions seriously, passed an
olive garden and saw the Seventeen ... and with them was the
Eighteenth, the one they had crucified the Friday before. "Magna
Mater", he swore, creeping closer, "am I losing my mind?" The
Eighteenth, whatshisname, the preacher, had set up a wheel and
was distributing cards to them. Now, he turned the wheel and
called out the number at which it stopped. The centurion watched,
in growing amazement, as the process was repeated several times,
and the cards were marked each time the wheel stopped. Finally,
the big one, Simon, shouted "Bingo!" The scion of the noble
Linctus family turned and fled ... Behind him, the luminous
figure said, "Do this in commemoration of me."
 "I thought we were supposed to do the bread and wine bit in
commemmoration of you?" Simon objected.

"Then again--'BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--' you never had fits, my

"Never!" said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the
Lizard as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off
writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no
mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was
trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)

hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other.

but I hadn't quite finished my tea when I was sent for.'
 `You ought to have finished,' said the King. `When did you
begin?'
The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into
the court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. `Fourteenth of March, I
think it was,' he said.
 `Fifteenth,' said the March Hare.
 `Sixteenth,' added the Dormouse.
 `Write that down,' the King said to the jury, and the jury
eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then
added them up, and reduced the answer to shillings and pence.
-- Lewis Carroll, "Alice's Adventures In Wonderland"
%%
One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course,
Alice could not stand, and she went round the court and got
behind him, and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away.
She did it so quickly that the poor little juror (it was Bill,
the Lizard) could not make out at all what had become of it; so,
after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to write with one
finger for the rest of the day; and this was of very little use,
as it left no mark on the slate.

Dear Mister Language Person: What is the purpose of the
apostrophe?
Answer: The apostrophe is used mainly in hand-lettered small
business signs to alert the reader than an "S" is coming up at
the end of a word, as in: WE DO NOT EXCEPT PERSONAL CHECK'S, or:
NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY ITEM'S. Another important grammar concept
to bear in mind when creating hand- lettered small-business signs
is that you should put quotation marks around random words for
decoration, as in "TRY" OUR HOT DOG'S, or even TRY "OUR" HOT
DOG'S.

could only communicate with him via email, even they all shared
the same office. She also writes: "Pretty graphical interfaces
are commonly called user-friendly. But they are not really your
friends. Underlying every user-friendly interface is terrific
contempt for the humans who will use it. ...to build a
crash-proof system, the designer must be able to imagine--and
disallow--the dumbest action possible. He or she has to think of
every single stupid thing a human being could do. Gradually, over
months and years, the designer's mind creates a construct of the
user as an imbecile. This image is necessary. No crash-proof
system can be built unless it is made for an idiot."

  was upward of one million three hundred thousand miles long,
  and stuck out over the Gulf of Mexico like a fishing-rod. And

I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little
death that brings total oblivion. I will face my fear. I will
permit it to pass over me and through me and turn my inner eye to
follow its path. When the fear is gone, only I will remain.

I must not have fun. Fun is the time-killer. Fun is for

through it. And when the fun is gone only I will remain -- I, and

In closing, I'd like to repost my 3 axioms of Usenet. I
originally posted these in 1987 and 1988. In my opinion as a
semi-pro curmudgeon, I think they've aged well:
*Axiom #1:* "The Usenet is not the real world. The Usenet usually
does not even resemble the real world."
*Corollary #1:* "Attempts to change the real world by altering
the structure of the Usenet is an attempt to work sympathetic
magic -- electronic voodoo."
*Corollary #2:* "Arguing about the significance of newsgroup
names and their relation to the way people really think is
equivalent to arguing whether it is better to read tea leaves or
chicken entrails to divine the future."
*Axiom #2:* "Ability to type on a computer terminal is no
guarantee of sanity, intelligence, or common sense."
*Corollary #3:* "An infinite number of monkeys at an infinite
number of keyboards could produce something like Usenet."
*Corollary #4:* "They could do a better job of it."
*Axiom #3:* "Sturgeon's Law (90% of everything is crap) applies
to Usenet."
*Corollary #5:* "In an unmoderated newsgroup, no one can agree on
what constitutes the 10%."
*Corollary #6:* "Nothing guarantees that the 10% isn't crap,
too."
Which of course ties in to the recent (1992): "Usenet is like a
herd of performing elephants with diarrhea -- massive, difficult
to redirect, awe-inspiring, entertaining, and a source of
mind-boggling amounts of excrement when you least expect it."

When primitive humans first came along, they did not engage in
business as we now think of it. They engaged in squatting around
in caves naked. This went on for, I would say, roughly two or
three million years, when all of a sudden a primitive person,
named Oog, came up with an idea.
 "Why not," he said, "pile thousands of humongous stones on top
of each other in the desert to form great big geometric shapes?"
Well, everybody thought this was an absolutely terrific idea. It
wasn't until several thousand years later that they realized they
had been suckered into a classic "pyramid" scheme, and of course,
by that time, Oog was in the Bahamas.

``I decided to leave and go to California, so I packed up my

  up by one of those huge trailer trucks carrying 20 brand new
  cars. I climbed up the side of the cab and opened the door. The
  guy said, "I don't have much room up here, why don't you get
  into one of the cars out back." So I did. And he was really
  into picking people up because he picked up 19 more. We all had
  our own cars. Then he went 90 miles per hour and we all got
  speeding tickets.''

``Let's talk about how to fill out your 1984 tax return. Here's

  agent is going to want to spend hours poring over a
  sweat-stained document. So even if you owe money, you can put
  in for an enormous refund and the agent will probably give it
  to you, just to avoid an audit. What does he care? It's not his

``... Now you're ready for the actual shopping. Your goal should
  be to get it over with as quickly as possible, because the
  longer you stay in the mall, the longer your children will have
  to listen to holiday songs on the mall public-address system,
  and many of these songs can damage children emotionally. For
  example: "Frosty the Snowman" is about a snowman who befriends
  some children, plays with them until they learn to love him,
  then melts. And "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" is about a
  young reindeer who, because of a physical deformity, is treated
  as an outcast by the other reindeer. Then along comes good, old
  Santa. Does he ignore the deformity? Does he look past
  Rudolph's nose and respect Rudolph for the sensitive reindeer
  he is underneath? No. Santa asks Rudolph to guide his sleigh,
  as if Rudolph were nothing more than some kind of headlight
  with legs and a tail. So unless you want your children exposed
  to this kind of insensitivity, you should shop quickly.''

*A Plan for the Improvement of English Spelling*
For example, in Year 1 that useless letter "c" would be dropped
to be replased either by "k" or "s", and likewise "x" would no
longer be part of the alphabet. The only kase in which "c" would
be retained would be the "ch" formation, which will be dealt with
later. Year 2 might reform "w" spelling, so that "which" and
"one" would take the same konsonant, wile Year 3 might well
abolish "y" replasing it with "i" and Iear 4 might fiks the "g/j"
anomali wonse and for all.
Jenerally, then, the improvement would kontinue iear bai iear
with Iear 5 doing awai with useless double konsonants, and Iears
6-12 or so modifaiing vowlz and the rimeining voist and unvoist
konsonants. Bai Iear 15 or sou, it wud fainali bi posibl tu meik
ius ov thi ridandant letez "c", "y" and "x" -- bai now jast a
memori in the maindz ov ould doderez -- tu riplais "ch", "sh",
